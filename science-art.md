This is a gallery of **science-inspired art** — pastel, minimal illustrations based on cells, chromatin, neural systems, and developmental patterns.

In time, this page will include:
- standalone illustrations  
- visual abstracts  
- elements from explainers and carousels  

For now, it’s a home for science-art that aims to make complex ideas feel gentle and approachable.
