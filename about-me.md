    <p><strong>Hi, I’m Ayanthi.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Sci-On is my little corner of the internet for science communication and art.

I am currently a graduate student at the Tata Institute for Genetics and Society. I study how neural precursor cells in *Drosophila* know which neurons to make - how they "read" positional and temporal cues to produce the right neuronal types. Broadly, I am interested in developmental biology, behaviour, and evo-devo. Outside the lab, I like to sing, draw, design, and write a little. Also, I sincerely believe in the unifying power of Bollywood dance moves, and I sometimes practise said moves with my cats, Mitthu and Kiki!
