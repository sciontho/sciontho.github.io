Let's try and think like Tinbergen:

<div class="poem-block" markdown="1">
  
***One**, "It's thus. What makes it so?"*  
***Two**, "Huh. But why should it be so?"*  
***Three**, "How has it come to be,*  
*What ingredients make the recipe?"*  
***Finally**, it must be solved*  
*How on earth has this evolved?*  

</div>

Welcome, welcome!

Tinbergen reckons that to understand behaviour, one must ask questions of four kinds - questions on "Causation", "Function", "Development" and "Evolution". And this shall serve as the foundation for the kinds of papers we’ll geek out on. So, we'll look at:

- **Causation** – What immediate processes cause the behaviour?  
- **Development** – How does the behaviour emerge?  
- **Function** – Why does it exist? What does it do for the animal?  
- **Evolution** – How did it arise over time?

We’ll interpret these terms freely (you’ll see!). Overall, though, these four lenses guide how I read papers and think about science.
